## What is this?
A front end to easily create presentations using [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js/). 
This tries to minimize on the ammount of HTML that needs to be written by using markdown for the slide
content.

## How to use

1. Download the files
2. Install bundler:
    gem install bundler
3. Install the gems needed with bundler
    bundle install
4. Start up the config.ru file with thin/unicorn/passenger/whatever
5. Go to localhost
6. Go make your presentations!

## Features

* Nice interface to quickly make deck.js based presentations
* Uses Markdown for presentation markup

## Todo

* Something that gives me an image of a preview of the presentation or something
* Settings for adding deck.js plugins etc
* Other bugfixing
